I use Bodhi linux for my installation because it is lightweight on my old laptop.
If you are using macbook air 2014, run the wifi driver installation
```
sudo apt-get install broadcom-sta-source broadcom-sta-dkms broadcom-sta-common

```
Install Flatpak
Install the following app from Flatpak
- Koodo reader (epub reader)
- Notesnook (note offline)
- localsend
